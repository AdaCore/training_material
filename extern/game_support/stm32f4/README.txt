This example is used by the tutorial located in the GNAT Pro User’s Guide Supplement for Cross Platforms.  The tutorial is in the Annex titled "Tutorial: Embedded ARM Ada Project." 

The User’s Guide Supplement is accessible within GPS via the Help menu.  It is also available on disk in various formats, under the "share/doc/gnat-cross" folder tree located under the compiler installation directory.  The specific file is named "gnat_ugx.*", where the extension "*" reflects the file type.  For example, the PDF version is named "gnat_ugx.pdf" and is located in the "share/doc/gnat-cross/pdf" folder.  Other formats are located in specific directories at the same level as the "pdf/" directory.

The tutorial explains how and when to start GPS on the project.

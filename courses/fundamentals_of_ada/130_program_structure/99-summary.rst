Summary

* Hierarchical library units address important issues

   - Direct support for subsystems
   - Extension without recompilation
   - Separation of concerns with controlled sharing of visibility

* Parents should document assumptions for children

   - "These must always be in ascending order!"

* Children cannot misbehave unless imported ("with'ed")
* The writer of a child unit must be trusted

   - As much as if he or she were to modify the parent itself

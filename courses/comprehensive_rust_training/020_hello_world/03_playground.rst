The :url:`Rust Playground <https://play.rust-lang.org/>` provides an easy
way to run short Rust programs, and is the basis for the examples and
exercises in this course. Try running the "hello-world" program it
starts with. It comes with a few handy features:

-  Under "Tools", use the :rust:`rustfmt` option to format your code in the
   "standard" way.

-  Rust has two main "profiles" for generating code: Debug (extra
   runtime checks, less optimization) and Release (fewer runtime checks,
   lots of optimization). These are accessible under "Debug" at the top.

-  If you're interested, use "ASM" under "..." to see the generated
   assembly code.

As students head into the break, encourage them to open up the
playground and experiment a little. Encourage them to keep the tab open
and try things out during the rest of the course. This is particularly
helpful for advanced students who want to know more about Rust's
optimizations or generated assembly.

------------------------
Specifying Directories
------------------------

+ Any number of Source Directories

  + Source Directories contain Source Files
  + By default, the directory that contains the project file
  + It is possible to create a project with no Source Directory

+ One Object Directory

  + Contains object files & any files generated by the tools
  + By default, the directory that contains the Project File

+ One Executables Directory

  + Contains the executables
  + By default, it is same as Object Directory

--------------------
Source Directories
--------------------

+ One or more in any project file
+ Default is same directory as project file
+ Can specify additional / other directories

   :ada:`for Source_Dirs use ("src/mains", "src/drivers", "foo");`

+ Can specify an entire tree of directories

   :ada:`for Source_Dirs use ("src/**");`

   + :filename:`src` and every subdirectory underneath

+ *Tip: use forward slashes rather than backslashes for the most portability*

   * Backslash will only work on Windows
   * Forward slash will work on all supported systems (including Windows)

--------------
Source Files
--------------

+ Must be at least one "immediate" source file

  + In one of the source directories of the project file
  + Unless explicitly specifies none present

     :ada:`for Source_Files use ();`

+ Can specify source files by name

  :ada:`for Source_Files use ("pack1.ads","pack2.adb");`

+ Can specify an external file containing source names

  :ada:`for Source_List_File use "source_list.txt";`

------------------
Object Directory
------------------

+ Specifies the location for compiler's output

  + Such as :filename:`.ali` files and object files
  + For the project's immediate sources

  .. code:: Ada

     project Release is
        for Object_Dir use "release";
        ...
     end Release;

+ Only one per project

  + When extending a parent project the child's object directory is used for any inherited sources not already compiled in the parent

----------------------
Executable Directory
----------------------

+ Specifies the location for executable image

   .. code:: Ada

      project Release is
         for Exec _Dir use "executables";
         ...
      end Release;

+ Default is same directory as object files
+ Only one per project

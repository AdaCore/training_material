# Overview

This folder contains a source example that is based on the GNAT Studio
tutorial example (copied from share/examples/gnatstudio/tutorial for
version 24.0).

The example has been modified to use a base project and two subprojects
to demonstrate GNAT Coverage abilities.

There are better ways to write the source code, but (for now) it is
unnecessary to update the code as it does not affect the purpose of the lab.

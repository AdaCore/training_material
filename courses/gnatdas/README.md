# Overview

This folder is a collection of modules for teaching GNAT Dynamic Analysis Suite
(GNATDAS). Each module is an RST file that may include files from the *labs*
folder or *examples* folder.

The file **standard_course.txt** contains a list of all the modules that
we expect to find in a typical *GNAT DAS* course. If you need
to modify the list of included modules, this is the file you would change
(but don't check it into MASTER!)

## Naming Scheme

The module naming scheme uses a 3-digit prefix, followed by an underscore and
then the description of the module (all lower case, words separated by "\_").
The file extension for all modules should be ".rst". The 3-digit prefix
should be used to suggest the proper order for teaching the modules.

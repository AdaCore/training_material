# Overview

This folder is a collection of modules for teaching GNAT Dynamic Analysis Suite
(GNATDAS). Each module is an RST file that may include files from the *labs*
folder or *examples* folder.

The file **standard_course.txt** contains a list of all the modules that
we expect to find in a typical *GNAT DAS* course. If you need
to modify the list of included modules, this is the file you would change
(but don't check it into MASTER!)

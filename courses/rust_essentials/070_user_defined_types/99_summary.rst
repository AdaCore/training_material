What We Learned
-----------------

-  Structs (Data Aggregation)

   -  Purpose: Group related data into a single, named unit (composition) 

   -  Key Rules: Full field initialization is mandatory

   -  Syntax: Includes the Struct Update Operator (..) for easy copying

   -  Forms: Covers Named Structs, Tuple Structs, and the Newtype Idiom (for type safety)

-  Enums (Data Choices)

   -  Purpose: Define a type that can be one of a fixed set of options

   -  Associated Data: Variants can optionally carry specific data (tuple or struct-like)

   -  Specific case : the State Machines (mutually exclusive states)

-  A type alias rename an existing type to improved readability

What We Covered
-----------------

* **Methods**

  * Just functions tied to a type
  * They use the :rust:`self` receiver for ergonomic syntax
  * Static methods act like constructors or helpers
  * Syntax helps group functionality logically

* **Traits**

  * Define contracts for behavior
  * Types must implement all required methods
  * Can have defaults
  * Bounds enable generic functions and polymorphism

* **Deriving**

  * Automatically generates standard trait implementations for a type based on its structure

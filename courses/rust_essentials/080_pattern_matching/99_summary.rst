What We Covered
-----------------

- **Patterns are Fundamental**

    - Every variable binding is a pattern match
    - The :rust:`match` keyword lets you match a value against one or more patterns

- **Destructuring for Clarity**

    - Pull data out of Structs and Enums directly into variables
    - Use :rust:`..` to ignore fields and keep code concise

- **Safer Control Flow**

    - :rust:`match` ensures exhaustive handling of all possibilities
    - :rust:`if let` and :rust:`while let` provide concise alternatives for single patterns

- **Code Flattening**

    - Use :rust:`let else` to handle errors early and reduce nesting

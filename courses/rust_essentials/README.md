# Overview

This folder is a collection of modules for teaching the Rust language.

The file **standard_course.txt** contains a list of all the modules that
we expect to find in a typical *Rust Essentials* course. If you need
to modify the list of included modules, this is the file you would change.

This course was copied from https://github.com/raph-amiard/LASY-epita

## Naming Scheme

The module naming scheme uses a 3-digit prefix, followed by an underscore and
then the description of the module (all lower case, words separated by "\_").
The file extension for all modules should be ".rst". The 3-digit prefix
should be used to suggest the proper order for teaching the modules.

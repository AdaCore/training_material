What We Learned
-----------------

-  **Structs** (data aggregation)

   -  Group related data into a single, named entity (composition) 

   -  Full field initialization is mandatory

   -  Uses the Struct Update Operator (..) for easy copying

   -  Includes Named-field structs, Tuple structs, and the newtype Idiom

-  **Enums** (data choices)

   -  Define a type that can be one of a fixed set of options

   -  Variants can optionally carry specific data (tuple or struct-like)

   -  State machines idiom

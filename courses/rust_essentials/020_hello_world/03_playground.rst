The :url:`Rust Playground <https://play.rust-lang.org/>` provides an easy
way to run short Rust programs, and is the basis for the examples and
exercises in this course. Try running the :command:`hello-world` program it
starts with. It comes with a few handy features:

-  Under :menu:`Tools`, use the :menu:`rustfmt` option to format your code in the
   "standard" way.

-  Rust has two main :dfn:`profiles` for generating code: **Debug** (extra
   runtime checks, less optimization) and **Release** (fewer runtime checks,
   lots of optimization). These are accessible under :menu:`Debug` at the top.

-  If you're interested, use :menu:`ASM` under :menu:`...` to see the generated
   assembly code.

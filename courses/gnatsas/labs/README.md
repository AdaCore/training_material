# Overview

This folder contains labs to be used in teaching the tools included in the
GNAT Static Analysis Suite. The filename for the lab should match that of
the module that includes it, with the exception that the text ".lab" should
be inserted bewteen the filename and the file extension. (e.g. a lab for
module *100_some_module.rst* should be named *100_some_module.lab.rst*).

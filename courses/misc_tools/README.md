# Overview

This folder is a collection of modules for teaching various AdaCore/GNAT
tools. Each module is an RST file that focuses on one simple tool.
(More complicated tools should be in their own folder).

## Naming Scheme

The module naming scheme uses a 3-digit prefix, followed by an underscore and
then the description of the module (all lower case, words separated by "\_").
The file extension for all modules should be ".rst". In this folder,
he 3-digit prefix should be used for grouping purposes only.

# Overview

This folder is a collection of modules for teaching SPARK concepts. The
course content assumes a knowledge of Ada.
Each module is an RST file that may include files from the *labs* folder.

The file **standard_course.txt** contains a list of all the modules that
we expect to find in a typical "SPARK Essentials" course. If you need
to modify the list of included modules, this is the file you would change
(but don't check it into MASTER!)

## Naming Scheme

The naming scheme for the contents of this folder can be found
in the Style Guide at the top level of this repository.

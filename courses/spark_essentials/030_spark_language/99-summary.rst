SPARK Language
----------------

* SPARK was designed **for formal analysis**
* **Soundness** is key!

  - No language ambiguities
  - Hence regular functions without side-effects
  - Hence absence of interferences

* Still, SPARK subset is most of Ada 2022

  - All categories of types
  - OO programming with LSP
  - Concurrency with Ravenscar and Jorvik
  - Pointer programs with ownership

* Recommendations for migration from Ada or C

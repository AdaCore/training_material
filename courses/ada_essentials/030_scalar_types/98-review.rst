Things We Learned
-------------------

* Scalar types can be broken down into

  * Discrete types

    * Integer-based numeric types
    * Enumerated types

  * Floating-point types

    * Allows large range of fractional numbers

* Scalar types have typical operations

  * Equality/inequality, relational
  * Math for numeric types

* Types have *attributes*

  * Programmatic ways of getting information about how the type is defined

* Subtypes allow us to further constrain our types

  * Without creating new types

Tasking Control
=================

--------------------------
Synchronous Task Control
--------------------------

* Primitives synchronization mechanisms and two-stage suspend operation

   - No critical section
   - More lightweight than protected objects

* Package exports a `Suspension_Object` type

   - Values are :ada:`True` and :ada:`False`, initially :ada:`False`
   - Such objects are awaited by (at most) one task

      + But can be set by several tasks

.. code:: Ada

   package Ada.Synchronous_Task_Control is
      type Suspension_Object is limited private;
      procedure Set_True (S : in out Suspension_Object);
      procedure Set_False (S : in out Suspension_Object);
      procedure Suspend_Until_True (S : in out Suspension_Object);
      function Current_State (S : Suspension_Object) return Boolean;
   private
      ...
   end Ada.Synchronous_Task_Control;

---------------
Timing Events
---------------

* User-defined actions executed at a specified wall-clock time

   - Calls back an :ada:`access protected procedure`

* Do not require a :ada:`task` or a :ada:`delay` statement

  .. code:: Ada

     package Ada.Real_Time.Timing_Events is
        type Timing_Event is tagged limited private;
        type Timing_Event_Handler is access protected procedure (
            Event : in out Timing_Event);
        procedure Set_Handler (Event   : in out Timing_Event;
                               At_Time : Time;
                               Handler : Timing_Event_Handler);
        function Current_Handler (Event : Timing_Event)
                                  return Timing_Event_Handler;
        procedure Cancel_Handler (Event     : in out Timing_Event;
                                  Cancelled : out Boolean);
        function Time_Of_Event (Event : Timing_Event)
                                return Time;
     private
        ...
     end Ada.Real_Time.Timing_Events;

Execution Time Clocks
-----------------------

* Not specific to Ravenscar / Jorvik
* Each task has an associated CPU time clock

   - Accessible via function call

* Clocks starts at creation time

    - **Before** activation

* Measures the task's total execution time
    
    - Including calls to libraries, O/S services...
    - But not including time in a blocked or suspended state

* System and runtime also execute code

   - As well as interrupt handlers
   - Their execution time clock assignment is implementation-defined

-------------------------------
Partition Elaboration Control
-------------------------------

* Library units are elaborated in a partially-defined order

   - They can declare tasks and interrupt handlers
   - Once elaborated, tasks start executing
   - Interrupts may occur as soon as hardware is enabled

      * May be during elaboration

* This can cause race conditions

   - Not acceptable for certification

* :ada:`pragma Partition_Elaboration_Policy`

------------------------------
Partition Elaboration Policy
------------------------------

* :ada:`pragma Partition_Elaboration_Policy`

   - Defined in RM Annex H "High Integrity Systems"

* Controls tasks' activation
* Controls interrupts attachment
* Always relative to library units' elaboration
* **Concurrent policy**

  - Activation at the end of declaration's scope elaboration
  - Ada default policy

* **Sequential policy**

  - Deferred activation and attachment until **all** library units are activated
  - Easier scheduling analysis

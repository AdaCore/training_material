# Content of the directory

This directory contain quizzes.

Quizzes are **templates** for standalone Ada projects with multiple variants.

Given a template, it is concretizable into several projects, one per
choice. Those concrete projects will be *compile-run checked* by the tooling.

See `contrib/quiz.README.md` for a helper on the tools, and the format of the files
in the current directory

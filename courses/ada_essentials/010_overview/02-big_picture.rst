Big Picture

-----------------------
Core Language Content
-----------------------

All Ada compilers/run-times are required to support these "core concepts" of the language

* Types 

   * Language- and user-defined type definitions

* Subprograms

   * Differentiate between :ada:`function` (values) and :ada:`procedure` (action)

* Packages

   * Grouping of related entities

* Generic Units

   * Code templates

* Language-Based Concurrency

   * Multi-tasking and synchronization

* Exceptions

   * Separation of error handling from logical flow

* Dynamic memory management
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Contract-Based Programming
* Low Level Programming
* Mixed-language applications

---------------------------
Specialized Needs Annexes
---------------------------

In addition to the "core concepts", Ada compilers can also support 

* Real-Time Systems

   * Multi-tasking issues such as priority and timing

* Distributed Systems

   * Multiple partitions as part of a single Ada program

* Numerics

   * Complex arithmetic, improved floating point accuracy, and very large numbers

* High-Integrity Systems
* Information systems

They implement no additional syntax, and may be present or not depending on the compiler/run-time

Language Examination Summary
------------------------------

* Three main goals

   - **Reliability**, maintainability
   - Programming as a **human** activity
   - Efficiency

* Easy-to-use

   - ...and hard to misuse
   - Very **few pitfalls** and exceptions

So Why Isn't Ada Used Everywhere?

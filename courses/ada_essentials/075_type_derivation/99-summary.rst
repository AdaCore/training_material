* :dfn:`Primitive` of a type

   - Subprogram above **freeze-point** that takes or returns the type
   - Can be a primitive for **multiple types**

* Freeze point rules can be tricky
* Simple type derivation

   - Types derived from other types can only **add limitations**

      + Constraints, ranges
      + Cannot change underlying structure

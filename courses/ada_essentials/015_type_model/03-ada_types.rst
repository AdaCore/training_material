--------------------
Ada "Named Typing"
--------------------

* **Name** differentiates types
* Structure does **not**
* Identical structures may **not** be interoperable

   .. code:: Ada

      type Yen is range 0 .. 100_000_000;
      type Ruble is range 0 .. 100_000_000;
      Mine : Yen;
      Yours : Ruble;
      ...
      Mine := Yours; -- not legal

.. note::

   In Ada, types are like airport security: if your bag doesn't match
   the rules, you're not getting through

Understanding Types vs Subtypes
---------------------------------

* **Type** defines a distinct set of values and operations

* :dfn:`Subtype` (usually) restricts the range of values from a base type

   * Doesn't define a new type

   .. code:: Ada

      type Temperature is range -273 .. 5000;
      subtype Celsius is Temperature range -273 .. 100;

* Subtype that does **not** add a restriction (:ada:`subtype Distance_T is Meters_T`)
  is generally referred to as an *alias*

:color-white:`Blank space`

.. note::

   Subtypes are Ada's way of saying, "Yes, but not all the values, please."

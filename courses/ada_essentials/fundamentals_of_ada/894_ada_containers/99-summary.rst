Containers Review
-------------------

* Containers class is the ultimate "code re-use"

   - Solidifies most common containers used in coding
   - Full functionality

      + When writing your own, you may not create all the functions someone else neds

   - Part of the language, so reliability is much higher

* Availability depends on language-version and runtime

    - Typically not available on certified runtimes (e.g. Ravenscar)

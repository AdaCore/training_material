Summary

* :ada:`use` clauses are not evil but can be abused

   - Can make it difficult for others to understand code

* :ada:`use all type` clauses are more likely in practice than :ada:`use type` clauses

   - Added benefit: if the type being used is an enumerated type, all enumerals become visible as well

* :ada:`Renames` allow us to alias entities to make code easier to read

   - Subprogram renaming has many other uses, such as adding / removing default parameter values

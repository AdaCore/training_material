* Requirements

  * Convert the integer value to its character equivalent
  * Print a result according to the following rules:

    * If the character is a letter, convert it to the opposite case
    * If the character is not a letter but it is printable, print it
    * If the character is a line terminator, print its name
    * If none of the above apply, just print out "unprintable"

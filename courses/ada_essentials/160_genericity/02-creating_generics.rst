* Subprograms

   .. code:: Ada

      generic
         type T is private;
      procedure Swap (L, R : in out T);

* Packages

  .. code:: Ada

      generic
         type T is private;
      package Stack is
         procedure Push (Item : T);
      end Stack;

* Body is required

    - Will be specialized and compiled for **each instance**

* Children of generic units have to be generic themselves

   .. code:: Ada

      generic
      package Stack.Utilities is
         procedure Print (S : Stack_T);

Usage
-------

* Instantiated with the :ada:`new` keyword

.. code:: Ada

   --  Standard library
   function Convert is new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion
     (Integer, Array_Of_4_Bytes);
   --  Callbacks
   procedure Parse_Tree is new Tree_Parser
     (Visitor_Procedure);
   --  Containers, generic data-structures
   package Integer_Stack is new Stack (Integer);

* Advanced usages for testing, proof, meta-programming

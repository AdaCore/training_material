* Generics are useful for copying code that works the same just for different types

   - Sorting, containers, etc

* Properly written generics only need to be tested once

   - But testing / debugging can be more difficult

* Generic instantiations are best done at compile time

   - At the package level
   - Can be run time expensive when done in subprogram scope

* Generics aren't always the best solution

  * Sometimes a common routine will work just as well

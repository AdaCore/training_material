A Note about Syntax
---------------------

* We use Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to show syntax for many constructs

  * BNF for some constructs can be comprehensive
  * Shows a lot more than we need for this class

* BNF in this course may be simplified to focus only on our needs

  * Elements missing or renamed
  * Full BNF is available in the Reference Manual

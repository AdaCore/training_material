# Overview

This folder is a collection of courses for teaching SPARK/Ada. Each subfolder
is a collection of modules (written in RST). Although all modules are related
to the folder, it's possible a typical course may not include all the modules.
Each folder should have one file called "standard_course.txt" that contains a
list of the modules in a typical course presentation.
In addition, you can create other text files that combine modules from
multiple courses. This is useful for a combined class, or a review class,
or similar circumstances. Those files should be at this level.

Current courses are listed below. Each folder should have a "lab" folder 
containing any lab modules for the course (lab modules should have the
same name as their course module with ".lab" appended to the name).

## Fundamentals of Ada

This is the basic introduction class to Ada (or SPARK). This assumes no
prior knowledge of the language. All modules should be written towards
the Ada language itself (although references to SPARK are useful
where appropriate).  If there is a need for a SPARK-specific module,
it can be added as needed, and a special TXT file can be created.

## SPARK for Ada Programmers

This is a course designed to teach SPARK to students already familiar with
Ada. Some modules are overviews of newer Ada functions (Ada 2012 and beyond),
while most deal with actual SPARK programming and analysis

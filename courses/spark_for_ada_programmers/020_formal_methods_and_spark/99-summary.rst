Formal Methods and SPARK
--------------------------

* Development of large, complex software is **difficult**

  - Especially so for high-integrity software

|

* Formal methods **can** be used industrially

  - During development and verification
  - To address objectives of certification
  - They must be sound (no missing alarm) in general

|

* SPARK is an **industrially** usable formal method

  - Based on flow analysis and proof
  - At various levels of software assurance

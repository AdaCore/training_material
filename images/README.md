# Images

This directory contains images that are used either to generate docs or slides.
They can be included directly in a `.rst` file or through a latex template, etc...

Some rules apply to the images here so they're easier to use

* Use `lower_case` naming for files and directories
* Do not use `.jpg` but `.jpeg`
* Only image types can be stored here
* Images should be referenced in a source file, otherwise they may be flagged and
  removed.

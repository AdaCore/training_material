# Overview

This folder is a collection of Ada/SPARK overviews culled from the
*ada_essentials* and *spark_essentials* folder in courses.

The folder name will be a blunt description of the content within.
We're starting with "ada_8_hours" which will be an overview of Ada using
content culled from from *ada_essentials*.

We now have an "ada_4_hours" course - culled from the "ada_8_hours" overview,
with some of the less interesting modules moved to the end to be used
as time permits

# Overview

This folder is a collection of Ada/SPARK overviews culled from the
*fundamentals_of_ada* and *spark_for_ada_programmers* folder in courses.

The folder name will be a blunt description of the content within.
We're starting with "ada_8_hours" which will be an overview of Ada using
content culled from from *fundamentals_of_ada*.

Going forward, we can add other modules (we need "ada_4_hours"), in
addition to things like demos
